**Papers**: [PHDCC journal/conference abstract and paper submission and review system](https://www.phdcc.com/papers/).

To be used in conjuction with [phdcc-papers-api](https://github.com/phdccltd/phdcc-papers-api).
Please read the full set up instructions there.

To be updated for Nuxt3.

Create a `.env` text file in the root directory of this component with the following secrets:

```
NUXT_PORT=1234
API='https://papers.example.org/api'
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY='recaptcha site key'
```

Optionally add all these variables to send a mail when the production server is started:

```
STARTUP_EMAIL='to@example.com'
STARTUP_SUBJECT='Papers nuxt restarted'
STARTUP_FROM='from@example.com'
```

If running in a dev environment at localhost that calls a website server API, specify the server API `RECAPTCHA_BYPASS` to bypass the authenication recaptcha.
Do not put `RECAPTCHA_BYPASS` on your production site.

*Note: any values you put in this .env file WILL BE INCLUDED in the compiled code sent to the user.*

## Build Setup

```
# Grab the code
git clone https://github.com/phdccltd/phdcc-papers.git
cd phdcc-papers-api

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at eg localhost:1234
npm run dev

# For simple production use:
npm run build
npm run start

# For production in PM2, create an ecosystem file or start
npm run build
pm2Â start ./node_modules/nuxt/bin/nuxt.js --name papers -- start
```

## Updating

An existing installation had best do a full install rather than an update:

```
git pull
rm package-lock.json
rm -r node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

Then restart eg using pm2.

## Testing

This code has [Cypress End to End](https://www.cypress.io/) tests which generate coverage of the JavaScript/TypeScript in vue js and ts files.

The `clienttest` instance of this app must be run alongside the `forclient` instance of the Papers API code.
* Papers API `forclient`: runs using Sqlite3 in-memory database listening on a localhost port: `npm run forclient`
* Papers client `clienttest`: builds with coverage and runs at a local port access the API on its localhost port: `npm run clienttest`

You can then run Cypress interactively or using command: `npm run cypress`.
Coverage output is generated in `\coverage`.

```
CYPRESS_COVERAGE='true'
NUXT_PORT=3000
NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE='https://example.com'
NUXT_PUBLIC_API='http://localhost:9000/api'
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=''
```

## Used with thanks

Thanks to all the developers who produced the open-source modules that are used, including

* [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com), which is [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) 
* [bootstrap-vue-next](https://github.com/bootstrap-vue/bootstrap-vue-next), which is Bootstrap v5 for Vue/Nuxt.
